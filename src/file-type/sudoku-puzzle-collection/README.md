# Sudoku Puzzle Collection (.sdm)

This is a very simple format. Each line contains a single puzzle. The empty cells are represented by a zero, but the program also accepts other placeholders, like a dot “.”. Line breaks in Windows or Unix style are recognized, but when my software writes these files, CrLb is always used. These files cannot be written by SudoCue. The program can only read them.
